This data visualization project was created to monitor the success of volunteer driver dispatches
and volunteer engagement for a non-profit organization through a dashboard built in Looker Studio.
[Hand Up Toronto](https://handuptoronto.org) organizes the delivery of food boxes to support families
facing food insecurity in the community, which are delivered by volunteer drivers approximately every 2-4 weeks.

### Purpose and Motivation
The purpose of this dashboard was to allow data and reports to be more readily accessible
to executive team members after each dispatch. The previous version of this dashboard
was difficult to run for non-technical users and required sensitive data to be downloaded locally.
With the updated Looker dashboard, the reports can easily be referenced by
technical and non-technical team members that are provided access,
while sensitive personal data can be more safely stored and managed in the cloud on BigQuery.
