Hi, I'm Jennifer. I'm a recent Master of Data Science graduate with a background in immunological research.
While working in allergy research, I became interested in data science as
I used R programming for data analysis, data visualization, and statistical modeling
of biological and clinical datasets.

I'm currently seeking my next challenge as a data scientist, and I'm excited to bring my data science skills and curiosity into my next role.
